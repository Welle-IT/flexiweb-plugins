## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### NPM Package Management

#### Publishing Packages to NPM

This repository includes a GitHub Action that allows you to publish any package to NPM:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Publish Package to NPM" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the package you want to publish from the dropdown
5. Choose the version type (patch, minor, major) to determine how the version number will be incremented
6. Click "Run workflow" to start the publishing process

**Note:** This action requires an NPM access token stored as a GitHub secret named `NPM_TOKEN`.

#### Purging Packages from NPM

For maintenance purposes, you can purge all versions of a package from NPM using the "Purge Package from NPM" workflow:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Purge Package from NPM" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the package you want to purge from the dropdown
5. Type "PURGE" in the confirmation field (this is required to prevent accidental purges)
6. Leave "Dry run" set to "true" to preview what would be unpublished without actually doing it
7. Click "Run workflow" to start the process

When you're ready to actually purge the package:

1. Follow the same steps, but set "Dry run" to "false"
2. The workflow will unpublish all versions of the package from NPM

**Warning:** Purging packages is irreversible and may affect users who depend on your package. Use with caution.
