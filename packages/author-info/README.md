## [@flexiweb/author-info plugin](./src/index.ts)

This plugin makes collection track **who & when** **created, edited and published content** accross collections and globals.

Originally created by [Shefing](https://github.com/shefing/payload-tools).
Major changes:

- Replace moment with luxon
- Add better typing
- Add english, german and hungarian language support

### Features

ðŸ”¹ **Seamless Author Tracking** â€“ This plugin **automatically captures and stores** key authoring details, so you always know **who created, modified, and published** each document.  
ðŸ”¹ **Enhanced Metadata** â€“ While Payload CMS tracks creation and modification dates, it **doesnâ€™t store publication dates**â€”but this plugin does! Now, youâ€™ll have a clear **record of the most recent publish date** for every entry.  
ðŸ”¹ **Integrated Author Data** â€“ A new **"Author Data" tab** is added to the authoring interface, providing a centralized place for all user activity related to the document.

With this **fully automated** tracking system, you'll always have complete visibility into **who did what and when**â€”**without any extra effort**.

### Install
